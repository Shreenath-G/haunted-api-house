## 🎬 Scene 2: The Problem (15 seconds)

**Visual:** Show boring API testing tool (Postman/Insomnia screenshot)

**Voiceover:**
"API testing tools are functional but boring. You click buttons, read JSON, check status codes. It works, but it's not exactly exciting."

**Text Overlay:**
```
Traditional API Testing:
❌ Boring interface
❌ Forgettable errors
❌ No engagement
```

## 🎬 Scene 3: The Solution (15 seconds)

**Visual:** Transition to Haunted API House menu

**Voiceover:**
"What if we made API testing... fun? What if we combined it with a 1981 Atari horror game? That's Haunted API House - a true Frankenstein mashup."

**Text Overlay:**
```
Haunted API House:
✅ Retro gaming aesthetic
✅ Visual error feedback
✅ Actually functional
```

---

## 🎬 Scene 4: How It Works (30 seconds)

**Visual:** Show menu, import collection, start game

**Voiceover:**
"Here's how it works. You import an API collection - Postman format or custom JSON. The game generates a haunted mansion where each room represents an endpoint. You navigate as floating eyes, just like the original 1981 game. Enter a room to trigger a real API request."

**Text Overlay:**
```
1. Import API collection
2. Generate mansion
3. Navigate as eyes
4. Test endpoints
```

## 🎬 Scene 5: Success Demo (20 seconds)

**Visual:** Navigate to room, trigger request, collect urn piece

**Voiceover:**
"When a request succeeds, you collect an urn piece. The goal is to test all your endpoints successfully. Notice the authentic Atari aesthetic - limited colors, chunky pixels, CRT effects."

**Text Overlay:**
```
✅ Success = Urn Piece
🎨 Authentic Atari 2600 Graphics
🔊 Retro Sound Effects
```

---

## 🎬 Scene 6: Error Demo (25 seconds)

**Visual:** Trigger 404 error, show monster spawn

**Voiceover:**
"But when a request fails, a monster spawns! Different errors create different monsters. Purple ghost for 404, red demon for 500 errors, orange zombie for unauthorized. The monsters actually chase you, making errors memorable."

**Text Overlay:**
```
👻 404 = Ghost
😈 500 = Demon
🧟 401 = Zombie
🧛 403 = Vampire
```

## 🎬 Scene 7: Flashlight Mode (25 seconds)

**Visual:** Press SPACE, show flashlight mode with API details

**Voiceover:**
"Press SPACE for flashlight mode. Now you can see the full mansion and inspect API details - status codes, headers, response body, duration. It's a real API testing tool with full request inspection."

**Text Overlay:**
```
💡 Flashlight Mode:

## 🎬 Scene 8: The Tech (30 seconds)

**Visual:** Show code editor with key files

**Voiceover:**
"Under the hood, this is a true Frankenstein mashup. Dead tech from 1981 - Atari graphics, retro game mechanics, synthesized audio. Modern tech from 2025 - React, TypeScript, REST APIs, real-time state management. Two incompatible eras stitched together into something functional."

**Text Overlay:**
```
1981 Tech:
• Atari 2600 graphics
• Retro game mechanics

## 🎬 Scene 12: Why It Wins (30 seconds)

**Visual:** Split screen showing retro game + modern API testing

**Voiceover:**
"Haunted API House wins because it's a true Frankenstein creation - genuinely incompatible technologies working together. It's creative, technically impressive, and actually useful. It proves that developer tools don't have to be boring."

## 📝 Alternative Voiceover Scripts

### Shorter Version (2 minutes)

"Haunted API House - a Frankenstein mashup of 1981 Atari gaming and modern API testing.

Import your API collections, navigate a haunted mansion, and test endpoints by entering rooms. Success gives you urn pieces. Errors spawn monsters - purple ghosts for 404s, red demons for 500s.

Press SPACE for flashlight mode to inspect full API details - status, headers, response body.

Built entirely with Kiro in 2 hours. Over 2,000 lines of TypeScript combining retro aesthetics with functional API testing.

It's creative, technically impressive, and actually useful. Because developer tools don't have to be boring.

Check it out on GitHub. Test your APIs... if you dare."

### Technical Version (4 minutes)

"Let me show you Haunted API House - a technical deep dive into a Frankenstein mashup.

The architecture has four layers: React components for UI, game logic for mansion generation and state, a rendering engine using Canvas 2D, and an API client wrapping Axios.

The mansion generation algorithm takes your API endpoints and creates a procedural grid layout. Each endpoint becomes a room with corridors connecting them.

The game state uses React hooks for clean management. When you enter a room, it triggers a real HTTP request with full authentication support - Bearer tokens, Basic auth, API keys.

On success, you collect an urn piece. On error, we spawn a monster based on the error code. The monster type is determined by HTTP status - 404 becomes a ghost, 500 a demon, and so on.

The renderer has two modes: darkness with limited vision radius, and flashlight showing the full mansion. It uses authentic Atari 2600 colors and Canvas rendering for pixel-perfect retro graphics.

Audio is synthesized using Web Audio API - no samples, all procedural. Different waveforms for different events.

All of this was generated by Kiro through vibe coding. The entire game engine renderer - 300+ lines - was created in one shot with zero bugs.

The result is production-quality code that's modular, type-safe, and well-documented. A true showcase of AI-assisted development."

### Story Version (3 minutes)

"In 1981, Atari released Haunted House - the first horror video game. You played as floating eyes exploring a dark mansion, collecting pieces of an urn while avoiding monsters.

Fast forward to 2025. We have REST APIs, Postman collections, and boring testing tools.

I thought: what if we brought these together? What if API testing was an adventure?

So I built Haunted API House with Kiro. Import your API collections - they become rooms in a haunted mansion. Navigate as floating eyes, just like 1981. Enter rooms to test endpoints.

When requests succeed, you collect urn pieces. When they fail, monsters spawn. A purple ghost for 404 Not Found. A red demon for 500 Server Error. Each error becomes a memorable encounter.

Press SPACE for your flashlight - suddenly you can see everything. The full mansion layout, all your endpoints, and detailed API responses. It's Postman meets Pac-Man.

The aesthetic is authentic - real Atari 2600 colors, CRT scanlines, synthesized beeps and boops. But the functionality is modern - full HTTP client, authentication, environment variables.

Built in 2 hours with Kiro through conversational development. Over 2,000 lines of TypeScript, complete game engine, comprehensive documentation.

It's a Frankenstein creation in the truest sense - dead tech reanimated with modern capabilities. And it proves that work can be fun.

Because the best code is code that makes you smile."
